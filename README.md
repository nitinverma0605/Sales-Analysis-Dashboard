# 📊 Sales & Customer Performance Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This Power BI project delivers an end-to-end **Sales and Customer Performance Analysis** for an e-commerce dataset.

The business questions answered include:  
- How are monthly and quarterly sales trending over the last four years?  
- Which regions, categories, and segments are outperforming or underperforming compared to targets?  
- Which products and categories see the highest return rates?
